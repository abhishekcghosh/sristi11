                                <em>What is Innovation?</em> An innovation is one of those things that the society looks at and says, 
                                if we make <em>this</em> as a part of our life & work, it will definitely change the way we live & work. 
                                Just as energy is the basis of life itself, & ideas the source of innovation, so is innovation the 
                                vital spark of all human change, improvement & progress. With this view, a group of 10 jolites started 
                                a venture to think & do something out of the box & thus came into existence the <em>Center For Innovation</em>. 
                                A club where the 'ranchordas' of our college gather & put into practice the brilliant ideas that crop up 
                                in there '10 gallon' heads. The birth of this clib in the heart of Jolu occured on August 2008, & in these 
                                few years CFI has gone from strength to strength with its members increasing with the advent of time. 
                                It is the fully autonomous and not under the control of the union.

                                Thinking innovative ideas is one thing and implementing them is another. 
                                But the CFI <em>is</em> a club where ideas are <em>really</em> put into practice. 
                                All kinds of activities, from projects in robotics to workshops in various fields of engineering are in progress. 
                                Students are participating in various tech fests in leading institutes like the IITs, NITs etc. 
                                Apart from just building robots and training technology, students with a business acumen are engaging in B-Plan activites. 
                                Students are 'selling' their brainstorming ideas in B-Plan events conducted in IITs, NITs. 
                                Besides these, CFI has launched and operates the college radio "Radio-Jolite" which also has a registered frequency, 
                                where broadcasting of various college events occur.

                                CFI is the chief institution in the college which takes up the huge task of organizing Sristi,  the Annual Techno-Management Festival of
                                the college. CFI started with Sristi '10, the first version of Sristi, on the event of 50th year celebration of the college, and has 
                                emerged triumphant in terms of its success. This year, CFI brings to you yet another version of Sristi, that promises to be is bigger, better
                                and far more exhilarating.

                                Presently CFI is flocked with students from all years. CFI has its own experimental lab & the construction of its 
                                building is in progress beside the college gymnasium. CFI has a very strong potential to be made into the R&D (Research & Development) Department  
                                of the college. Thus as a club, or rather being more than just a club, an institution, CFI is encouraging Jolu to think differently, break the shackles & come up with new ideas. 
                                It is asking Jolu to discard the monotony of convention & do something exquisite, entrancing & mesmerising.
